                <h5>What are the difference between authorization and authentication ?</h5>
                <p>Authorization is the process of validating a user's access to a specific subset of data, whereas authentication is the act of proving a person's identity. Authorization is the process of granting someone permission to perform a given action. On the other side, authentication is the process of proving that the request comes from a legitimate source. When we authorize someone to perform a task based on a certain authorization, we are authorizing them to perform that task. And when we authenticate someone, we're determining whether or not they're genuine</p>
